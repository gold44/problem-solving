# Problem Solving
Yeah, the repository name is lame, I agree. It's just a compilation of code when I study and prepare for my job interview technical exercises.

I study both algorithm related and scenario based problem solving questions. I don't believe these tests really help in hiring any better (if not the best) developer. Having said that, I have no choice but to go by the book since it's the job I want.

> **Disclaimer**: All the solutions are found by Googling. I have personally tested it to ensure it works as expected. I refactor some of them to make it the coding style I prefer so that it's easier to read while I'm studying the answers.

## Project Structure
1. It's a maven Java project. I'll try my best to organize it such that **one** class contains the complete solution of **one** problem or **one** algorithm. 
2. `Main` class is the entry point that invokes all other classes that execute their own solution. 

> **Disclaimer**: Most of the solutions do not have error / exceptional handling. It's with the assumption of test data should be provided correctly in order to verify the implementation.
